    To be honest with you: my passion for travel came out of the blue during my teenage years.
I’ve always traveled a bit around Italy with my family when I was a child. I enjoyed it but I always looked at those trips like basic holidays, 
like the one everyone does to escape from their boring life so I always had a very distort vision on how traveling really looks like. In fact, 
as a teen, I always looked at journeys simply as a way to relax and switch off.
However, there’s been a monent in my life where I finally opened my eyes.
