        <p>
            To be honest with you, my passion for travel came out of the blue during my teenage years.
            I’ve always traveled a bit around Italy with my family when I was a child. I enjoyed it but I always looked at those trips like basic holidays,
            like the one everyone does to escape from their boring life. So I always had a very distorted vision of how traveling really looks like.
        </p>
        <p>
            In fact, as a teen, I always looked at journeys simply as a way to relax and switch off.
            However, there was a moment in my life where I finally opened my eyes.
